# AI World Editor (AiWorldEd)

We use Three.js for rendering and math, no other third-party libraries.

This is a 3D map editor to build 3D worlds for video games.

## Unit testing requirement

Every new feature MUST have a properly documented unit test. This test must be
robust enough to stand the test of time (no hardcoded positions, rotations, they
must create what they need, test the result, check the result).

## After making changes

`bun run testrun` (vitest is used) must pass all checks.

`bun run build` must pass.

`bun run typecheck:strict` must pass.

PowerShell is janky, use cmd.

## Coding Style

1. Use many classes distributed across many separate files.
2. Never allow any single file to exceed 1000 lines of code.
3. As soon as a file approaches or reaches the 1000-line limit, stop writing in that file and immediately split its contents into additional classes and files.
4. Prefer many small functions over large functions.
5. No function may exceed 20 lines of code.
6. Every function must include a complete documentation comment that documents all arguments.
7. Do not write any inline comments.
8. Convey intent exclusively through verbose variable names and verbose function names.
9. Design the codebase so that future agents can locate functions and systems quickly.
10. Employ a clear, logical directory structure.
11. Use descriptive class names.
12. Separate concerns into many distinct files.
13. Name all files and folders using snake_case (never camelCase or PascalCase).
14. Create base classes for all groups of similar things and derive specialized classes from those base classes.
15. File names and class names must place the category or type first, followed by the specific name. This ensures related items group together.
    Correct examples:
    input_password instead of password_input.
    input_text instead of text_input.
    error_editor_startup instead of editor_startup_error.
    Always use the pattern category_specific_name.
16. Directory structure should group together related files specific to the feature.
    Correct examples:
    ```
    tools/
    	paintbrush/
    		states/
    			paintbrush_state.ts
    			paintbrush_state_idle.ts
    			paintbrush_state_drawing.ts
    			paintbrush_state_preview.ts
    		configurations/
    			paintbrush_configuration.ts
    			paintbrush_configuration_brush_size.ts
    			paintbrush_configuration_brush_palette.ts
    			paintbrush_configuration_layout.ts
    		layouts/
    			paintbrush_layout.ts
    			paintbrush_layout_default.ts
    			paintbrush_layout_blender.ts
    		renderers/
    			paintbrush_renderer.ts
    			paintbrush_renderer_stroke.ts
    			paintbrush_renderer_line.ts
    		ui/
    			window/
    				paintbrush_window.ts
    				paintbrush_window_floating.ts
    				paintbrush_window_detached.ts
    				buttons/
    					paintbrush_window_button_palette_color.ts
    		mcp/
    			paintbrush_mcp.ts
    			paintbrush_mcp_brush_select.ts
    			paintbrush_mcp_brush_paint.ts
    solid/
    	algorithm/
    		routing/
    			solid_algorithm_routing_table.ts
    			solid_algorithm_routing_table_builder.ts
    			solid_algorithm_routing_table_cache.ts
    ```
17. Prefer more functions over doing many unrelated things in one function.
    Function names should also be grouped by category e.g. finishingFlagReset instead of resetFinishingFlag.
    Bad example:

    ```
    /**
     * Activates the inline rename by placing the input where the name span sits,
     * before trailing row controls (visibility / lock). Input metrics are copied
     * from the span first so tabs and outliner rows keep their height.
     */
    activate(): void {
    	if (this.isDisposed) return;
    	this.isFinishing = false;
    	this.textSpan.style.display = 'none';
    	this.parentElement.insertBefore(this.inputElement, this.textSpan.nextSibling);
    	this.inputElement.focus();
    	this.inputElement.select();
    }
    ```

    Good example:

    ```
    /**
     * Activates the inline rename mode.
     */
    activate(): void {
    	if (this.isDisposed) {
    		return;
    	}
    	this.finishingFlagReset();
    	this.matchInputLayoutToTextSpan();
    	this.textSpanHide();
    	this.inputElementInsertBeforeTrailingControls();
    	this.inputElementFocusAndSelect();
    }

    /**
     * Resets the finishing flag so a new rename session can begin cleanly.
     */
    private finishingFlagReset(): void {
    	this.isFinishing = false;
    }

    /**
     * Hides the original text span so the input element becomes the visible name.
     */
    private textSpanHide(): void {
    	this.textSpan.style.display = 'none';
    }

    /**
     * Inserts the input element into the parent at the exact position of the text span,
     * placing it before any trailing row controls such as visibility or lock buttons.
     */
    private inputElementInsertBeforeTrailingControls(): void {
    	this.parentElement.insertBefore(this.inputElement, this.textSpan.nextSibling);
    }

    /**
     * Moves keyboard focus to the input element and selects its entire content.
     */
    private inputElementFocusAndSelect(): void {
    	this.inputElement.focus();
    	this.inputElement.select();
    }
    ```

    Many functions allow small reusable actions that are easy to maintain.
    Benefits of Small Functions
    Readability: Short code blocks are easy to understand at a glance.
    Maintenance: Fixing a bug in one small function fixes it everywhere.
    Reusability: You can call the same logic multiple times without rewriting it.
    Testing: Checking a single small task is faster than testing a large block.

18. Documentation comments must always be kept current.
    Each documentation comment must describe only the exact intent and behavior of the function it belongs to.
    It must never describe the project as a whole, architectural context, or relationships to any other function.
    This is because other functions and the whole program architecture may change, old documentation describing old decisions is misleading, so every function must only talk about itself.
19. General purpose solutions such as a menu system can live in their own directories to be reused globally e.g. ui/menu/ and should be designed with base classes for special overrides in other places, but always prefer a design where the base classes are powerful enough to handle all use-cases.
20. Before you work on an assignment, ensure you perform a full directory and file listing, and always avoid re-inventing the wheel.
    It is better to modify or create a global base class to support the necessary functionality than to copy and paste code or write it from scratch.
    For example, do not create a new context menu implementation when we already have a menu system or context menu system, reuse, improve, document, test.
21. Ensure the directory and file structure of tests matches that of the sources as much as possible and keep them in sync.
22. Prefer verbose descriptive names to ensure simple code searches are likely to find them.
23. Systems must always be in child folders that belong together to avoid random files scattered all over the project.
    It is better to implement new features in such a way that they minimally change the existing code and stay in their own subdirectory.
24. Avoid ! (non-null assertion) and rewrite the code to ensure TypeScript can be sure it is not null (with performance as highest priority).
25. Remove unused functions and unused variables.
26. If a function is very complicated and difficult to understand, split it into easier functions with detailed documentation comments (but priority is performance).
27. Code duplication is NOT ALLOWED, create a single function accessible from both code paths (static class, base class).

## Coordinates

The main difference you will find when working between ThreeJS and Unity is the
coordinate systems are different: ThreeJS uses right hand whereas Unity uses
left hand. But we want to be able to export maps to 3D models and Unity and
TrenchBroom and Blender. Keep this in mind.

## Theme

Use a similar dark mode theme that Blender uses. Orange selection, black
backgrounds, maybe a subtle gradient here and there to give the editor a very
dark blue vibe. But keep it modern and clean.

## Geometry

We keep meshes convex as that is easier to work with in level design.

## Reference

The reference folder is not part of the project that needs to be edited, it is
to get inspiration for math and code fixes and features. Ensure the names like
Chisel and RealtimeCSG do not end up in our map editor source code.

When code from the reference folder is used ensure it looks and feels different
and matches the style of our programming.
